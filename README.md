## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. 
There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea

Begin by compiling a comprehensive database of e-waste recycling facilities, drop-off centers, and collection events.
This database should include information such as addresses, contact details, operating hours, accepted items, and any fees associated with disposal.
Design an intuitive user interface for the application.
Users should be able to search for e-waste facilities based on their location, either manually entering an address or enabling geolocation services. 
Offer tips on how to properly prepare electronics for recycling and information on the recycling process itself.

## Technology Stack
React.js or Vue.js for building interactive user interfaces.
JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3.
Leaflet.js or Google Maps JavaScript API for integrating maps and location-based services.
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure for cloud hosting.
## Dependencies
In an e-waste facility locator application, dependencies refer to the external libraries, frameworks, and services that the application relies on to function properly.
These dependencies are typically managed using package managers and are essential for various aspects of the application's functionality. 
Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from the frontend.
